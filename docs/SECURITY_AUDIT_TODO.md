# Edge Functions — Security Audit Action Items

Findings from the 2026-04-15 review of `supabase/functions/`. Companion
docs: [SECURITY_REVIEW.md](SECURITY_REVIEW.md),
[SECURITY_REVIEW_2.md](SECURITY_REVIEW_2.md),
[RATE_LIMITING.md](RATE_LIMITING.md).

Items are grouped by severity. Each item has: what, why, where, how to
verify. SOC2 mapping column lines up with Trust Services Criteria for the
auditor's benefit.

## Legend

- **Severity**: 🔴 High — exploitable today · 🟠 Medium — hardening ·
  🟡 Low — audit polish.
- **SOC2**: Applicable Trust Services Criterion (CC = Common Criteria,
  A1 = Availability).
- **Status**: `[ ]` open · `[x]` done · `[-]` won't fix (with reason).

---

## 🔴 High

### [x] 1. Close the `/suggested-articles` auth hole

- **What**: `suggested-articles` is on the `PUBLIC_ALLOWLIST` in
  `scripts/check-edge-auth.ts` with the note "KNOWN GAP — no auth/origin
  gate. Tracked for follow-up; do not add new callers." It's openly
  callable with any `projectId`, which ships public in every widget
  snippet.
- **Why**: An attacker who scrapes a single widget-enabled page learns
  a valid `projectId` and can then enumerate every article in that
  project's corpus. Content exfiltration at scale.
- **Where**: `supabase/functions/suggested-articles/index.ts`,
  `scripts/check-edge-auth.ts` (`PUBLIC_ALLOWLIST`).
- **How**: Add the same `getProjectForArticlesAuth` + `isAllowedOrigin`
  check we added to `articles/`. The DI seam is already in place —
  inject a `getProjectForArticlesAuth` dep and reuse the articleDao
  helper. Then remove `suggested-articles` from `PUBLIC_ALLOWLIST`.
- **Verify**: The existing `auth-bypass guard` CI step must pass without
  the allowlist entry. Add a test that a request with a mismatched
  `Origin` returns 403.
- **SOC2**: CC6.1
- **Effort**: ~30 min. The refactor is mechanical.

### [x] 2. Rate-limit `/config`, `/analytics`, `/articles`

- **What**: `_shared/rateLimit.ts` only gates `chat` (20/visitor,
  500/project) and `suggestions` (5/200). The other public endpoints
  have no limits at all.
- **Why**:
  - `/config` — a scraper can enumerate every projectId at arbitrary
    rate, harvesting `allowed_urls`, ad tags, and other config.
  - `/analytics` — an attacker can flood the upstream proxy and burn
    the secondary project's budget; metrics can be poisoned.
  - `/articles` — same corpus-exfil concern as `/suggested-articles`
    above, just with an origin gate as a weak backstop.
- **Where**: `_shared/rateLimit.ts` (`LIMITS` map), plus call sites in
  each handler.
- **How**: Add `config`, `analytics`, `articles` keys to the `LIMITS`
  map. Suggested budgets: 30/min per visitor, 300/min per project for
  config/articles; 60/min per visitor, 1000/min per project for
  analytics (higher because it's the hot path). Call `checkRateLimit`
  right after the origin check in each handler, before the DB work.
- **Verify**: Unit test the 429 path using the DI seam (the rate-limit
  fn is already injectable in chat and suggestions — extend the other
  deps interfaces).
- **SOC2**: CC6.1, A1.2
- **Effort**: ~2 hours.

### [x] 3. Size-cap every handler that reads a request body

- **What**: `analytics/index.ts` does `await req.text()` and then
  forwards the result. `chat/index.ts` and `suggestions/index.ts` do
  `await req.json()` and then truncate *after* parsing. Both patterns
  load an arbitrarily large body into memory before checking.
- **Why**: DoS. A 50 MB POST gets parsed before the truncate step ever
  runs. Memory pressure + slow-loris style abuse.
- **Where**: All handlers that accept a body —
  `chat`, `suggestions`, `analytics`, `suggested-articles`,
  `conversations` (POST reset).
- **How**: Helper `enforceContentLength(req, maxBytes)` in
  `_shared/responses.ts` that (a) reads `content-length`, (b) returns a
  413 response if missing or over the cap. Call it at the top of every
  POST-accepting handler. Caps:
  - `chat`, `suggestions`: 64 KB (sanitizeContent already truncates to
    20 KB content + 1 KB title — 64 KB gives overhead).
  - `analytics`: 32 KB (events should be tiny).
  - `conversations/reset`: 4 KB (three IDs only).
- **Verify**: Test a request with `content-length: 999999` returns 413
  without the DAO stubs being called.
- **SOC2**: CC7.1, A1.2
- **Effort**: ~1 hour.

### [x] 4. Stop logging `visitor_id` in plaintext

- **What**: `chat/index.ts` logs `visitor_id` at several points (rate
  limit, token usage, cache writes).
- **Why**: SOC2 CC7.2 treats persistent identifiers as sensitive if
  they can be linked to individuals via other data. Cloud log retention
  is typically 30+ days — that's a lot of PII if a breach happens.
  Conversations/chat logs also need a look.
- **Where**: `chat/index.ts`, `conversations/index.ts`.
- **How**: Either (a) hash with a stable per-project salt before
  logging (`sha256(visitor_id + projectSalt).slice(0, 12)`), or (b)
  drop these logs to debug-only behind a `DEBUG_LOG_VISITOR_ID` env
  flag. Option (a) is better — it keeps logs useful for correlation
  while breaking the link to the visitor cookie.
- **Verify**: `grep -r "visitor_id" supabase/functions --include='*.ts'`
  in a log-pattern context should show zero plaintext hits.
- **SOC2**: CC7.2
- **Effort**: ~1 hour (helper + call-site sweep).

## 🟠 Medium

### [x] 5. Document the RAG trust boundary

Written up in [RAG_TRUST_BOUNDARY.md](RAG_TRUST_BOUNDARY.md). Key findings
worth re-reading after the audit:

- Ingest is admin-only via `admin_users` table; no publisher
  self-service today.
- Content is NOT sanitized on ingest and NOT sanitized on retrieval —
  RAG chunks enter the AI prompt verbatim as `AiCustomization.ragChunks`.
- The actual correction to the audit assumption: my earlier note said
  "sanitization runs at ingest". That was wrong — there is no
  sanitization at ingest either. The `rag-documents` write path in the
  parent repo inserts raw `source_content` and chunked text without
  calling `sanitizeContent`. Corrected in the doc.
- Blast radius of a compromised admin: prompt-injection into any
  project's chat output. Cannot read conversation data or exfiltrate
  across projects.
- The doc has a "what would change if we ever accepted publisher RAG"
  section listing the five mitigations that must land together before
  any self-service ingest path ships.

### [x] 6. Fill the `sanitizeContent` gaps

- **What**: The current sanitizer strips HTML tags, comments, and
  entities. It does NOT handle: zero-width/BiDi Unicode (U+200B,
  U+202E, variation selectors), NFKC normalization, or `<svg>` event
  handlers as a distinct class.
- **Why**: Low exploitability today, but a diligent auditor will ask.
  Zero-width injection can be used to smuggle instructions past human
  review of stored prompts.
- **Where**: `_shared/constants.ts` → `sanitizeContent`.
- **How**:
  - `text = text.normalize("NFKC")` at the top.
  - Strip Unicode categories Cf (format) and Cc (control) except for
    `\t\n\r`: `.replace(/[\p{Cf}\p{Cc}]/gu, "")` — but allow tabs and
    newlines back.
  - Add a specific `<svg>` strip before the generic tag strip (some
    SVG attributes can survive other encoding).
- **Verify**: Property test with fuzzed inputs including zero-width
  sequences and mixed-direction text.
- **SOC2**: CC6.7
- **Effort**: ~1 hour.

### [x] 7. Rotate or replace `CONFIG_BYPASS_KEY`

**Implementation notes (done):**

Chose option (2) — replaced the static key with an HMAC-signed
short-lived token. The static-key path is gone.

- New module [_shared/configBypassToken.ts](../supabase/functions/_shared/configBypassToken.ts)
  mirroring the visitorAuth HMAC pattern. Token format
  `v1|operator|expiresMs|hex-hmac`, signed over `v1|operator|expiresMs`
  with a new env var `CONFIG_BYPASS_SECRET`.
- Hard TTL ceiling of 1 hour (`MAX_BYPASS_TOKEN_TTL_MS`). Trying to
  mint a longer-lived token throws — the point is that anyone needing
  durable access should not be using the bypass.
- Operator field is an allowlisted `[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,32}` identifier
  passed at mint time. Attribution is now mandatory.
- config/index.ts accepts the token from either `?bypass_token=...`
  or the `x-config-bypass-token` header. Successful bypasses log
  `config: bypass token accepted` with the operator identifier; the
  raw token is never logged (tests assert this).
- `CONFIG_BYPASS_KEY` was being DOUBLY USED — also as the `x-api-key`
  header for outbound calls from `_shared/analytics.ts` to the
  secondary analytics proxy. Decoupled: analytics.ts now reads
  `ANALYTICS_PROXY_API_KEY` with a temporary fallback to the old
  var. Remove the fallback once the new secret is deployed everywhere.

**Env var migration checklist (for deploy):**

- [ ] Set `CONFIG_BYPASS_SECRET` via `supabase secrets set` — any
      random 32+ byte string. Different from any other secret.
- [ ] Set `ANALYTICS_PROXY_API_KEY` with the same value `CONFIG_BYPASS_KEY`
      currently holds, OR rotate it on the secondary project at the
      same time.
- [ ] Once verified in prod, unset `CONFIG_BYPASS_KEY` and remove the
      fallback in `_shared/analytics.ts`.
- [ ] Update internal tooling / runbooks that used the old
      `?bypass_key=...` query param. Minting a token is a one-liner
      with `issueConfigBypassToken("operator", ttlMs)` — add a CLI
      helper at `scripts/mint-config-bypass-token.ts` if callers need
      something repeatable.

- **What**: `config/index.ts` accepts a static `?bypass_key=...` that
  bypasses origin validation. Shared secret, env-configured, no TTL,
  no rotation mechanism, no usage audit.
- **Why**: SOC2 CC6.1 dislikes long-lived credentials without rotation
  or audit trail. If it ever leaks (screenshots, internal tickets, a
  curl dump) there's no way to know who used it or when.
- **Where**: `config/index.ts` lines 56–74.
- **How**: Two options:
  1. **Rotate + audit**: Add a rotation reminder, write a row to an
     `audit_log` table on every successful bypass with actor,
     timestamp, and source IP. Schedule quarterly rotation.
  2. **Replace**: Switch to a short-lived HMAC-signed token, using the
     same primitive as `configBypassToken.ts`. Admin tooling mints a
     15-minute token when it needs to debug a config.
- **SOC2**: CC6.1, CC7.3
- **Effort**: ~2 hours for (1), ~4 hours for (2).

### [-] 8. Add an `audit_log` table for destructive actions

**Won't fix (for now).** The `public.audit_log` table already exists in
the parent divee.ai repo
([supabase/migrations/20260408000004_audit_log.sql](https://github.com/scianid/divee.ai/blob/main/supabase/migrations/20260408000004_audit_log.sql))
and is used for back-office admin actions via the parent repo's
`_shared/audit.ts` helper. It carries `actor_id uuid NOT NULL`, which
fits admin identities but not anonymous widget visitors.

We considered widening the table and writing visitor-initiated
conversation resets/deletes into the same log. Decided against:

- Audit today is scoped to back-office operations where a human with a
  Supabase auth identity is accountable. Widget DELETE/reset calls are
  self-service over a cookie id — the audit value is much lower
  (visitor is the same person as owner), and the row volume would be
  dominated by visitor events, diluting the back-office signal.
- Cross-repo schema ownership: widening `public.audit_log` from the
  widget repo would mean the widget migrations start owning a table
  the parent repo also writes to. That's a coordination hazard we
  don't need.

**Revisit when** the widget grows an admin surface (publisher dashboard
that can delete conversations on behalf of a user), or when SOC2
specifically asks for visitor-event attribution. At that point:

- Option A: add a separate `widget_audit_log` table owned by the
  widget repo, keeping the back-office one untouched.
- Option B: coordinate with the parent repo to widen the shared table
  (add nullable `visitor_id`, `project_id` columns + a check
  constraint).

The analysis above is preserved so the next person doesn't rediscover
the same tradeoffs.

- **What**: ~~`DELETE /conversations/:id` and `POST /conversations/reset`~~
  *(Update 2026-04-23: both endpoints removed with the rest of `/conversations`.
  The motivating audit concern is gone; this item is retained only as
  historical context for any future visitor-initiated destructive
  actions that might land.)*
  Chat token usage is tracked but not security-relevant actions.
- **Why**: SOC2 CC7.3 wants an audit trail for security events. An
  incident responder needs to answer "was this conversation deleted
  by the owner or by an attacker?"
- **Where**: New migration + writes in `conversations/index.ts`.
- **How**:
  - Migration: `audit_log (id, project_id, visitor_id, action, target,
    source_ip, user_agent, created_at)`.
  - Helper `recordAuditEvent()` in `_shared/`.
  - Call it from DELETE and reset handlers *after* the DAO mutation
    succeeds.
- **SOC2**: CC7.3
- **Effort**: ~2 hours.

### [x] 9. Enable RLS on sensitive tables even though service-role
  bypasses it

**Already done in production.** Verified against
[supabase/schema-dump.sql](../../supabase/schema-dump.sql) — every
widget-sensitive table is already `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, and
the policy model splits cleanly between fail-closed tables and
back-office-scoped tables:

| Table | RLS | Policy model | Anon/auth result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ai_rate_limits` | ✅ on | no policies | default deny |
| `rag_documents` | ✅ on | no policies | default deny |
| `rag_chunks` | ✅ on | no policies | default deny |
| `conversations` | ✅ on | narrow SELECT for back-office project owners | no match for anon |
| `article_tag` | ✅ on | narrow SELECT for back-office project owners | no match for anon |
| `token_usage` | ✅ on | narrow SELECT for auth + service_role INSERT | no match for anon |
| `freeform_qa` | ✅ on | narrow SELECT for back-office owners | no match for anon |
| `project` / `project_config` / `project_ai_settings` | ✅ on | admin-only policies | no match for anon |

My earlier audit note ("RLS is dead code as a defense") was
imprecise. RLS is enabled; service-role traffic bypassing it is
correct by design. The belt-and-braces fail-closed state the item
asked for is the state we already have.

Nothing to change. Entry kept for the audit trail so a future reviewer
doesn't re-flag it without reading the schema dump.

- **What**: All edge functions use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` which
  bypasses RLS. RLS is therefore dead code as a defense — every access
  control decision is in the edge-function layer.
- **Why**: Belt-and-braces. If a future code path accidentally uses
  the anon key, or if service-role is ever scoped down, RLS becomes
  the fallback. SOC2 auditors specifically ask about RLS.
- **Where**: `supabase/migrations/` (new migration).
- **How**: `ALTER TABLE conversations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
  and similar for `ai_rate_limits`, `rag_documents`, `article_tag`,
  `audit_log`. Add one policy per table that denies anon access
  (`USING (false)`), so service-role still works but anon fails
  closed.
- **Verify**: An integration test using the anon key must fail; the
  same test with service-role must pass.
- **SOC2**: CC6.1
- **Effort**: ~2 hours.

### [ ] 10. Narrow the gitleaks test-fixture allowlist

- **What**: `.gitleaks.toml` at the repo root allowlists
  `supabase/functions/_tests/fixtures/`. Today we don't have a
  `fixtures/` subdirectory, but tests embed stub tokens like
  `"super-secret-bypass"` and `"opaque-good-token"` in the test files
  themselves.
- **Why**: Two problems:
  1. The allowlist path doesn't cover where our tests actually live
     (we put stubs in `_tests/*.test.ts`, not
     `_tests/fixtures/`). If gitleaks ever flags a stub, the allowlist
     won't help.
  2. If someone *does* create a `fixtures/` subdir later and drops a
     real secret there by mistake, the scanner will miss it.
- **Where**: `.gitleaks.toml` at widget repo root.
- **How**: Replace the directory allowlist with a regex match on
  specific stub strings used in tests
  (`super-secret-bypass`, `opaque-good-token`, etc.). Narrower surface.
- **SOC2**: CC8.1
- **Effort**: ~30 min.

## 🟡 Low / polish

### [ ] 11. Flip CodeQL from `continue-on-error: true` to `false`

- **Where**: `.github/workflows/edge-functions-ci.yml` line 110.
  Comment says "flip to false once we've cleaned up findings."
- **How**: Triage the current CodeQL findings. Fix or suppress with
  justification. Flip the flag. Add a task to `SECURITY_REVIEW.md`
  noting the target date.
- **SOC2**: CC8.1
- **Effort**: Depends on findings.

### [ ] 12. Document the `verify_jwt = false` design decision

- **Where**: `docs/SECURITY_REVIEW.md`.
- **How**: One paragraph: "JWT verification is disabled on every edge
  function because the widget is unauthenticated by design. Access
  control is enforced by (a) origin allowlist via `isAllowedOrigin`,
  (b) visitor HMAC token via `verifyVisitorToken` for
  conversation-scoped routes, (c) rate limiting via `checkRateLimit`.
  `scripts/check-edge-auth.ts` statically verifies every function
  enforces at least one of these and fails CI otherwise."
- **Why**: SOC2 auditors reflexively ask why JWT is off. Pre-empt the
  question.
- **SOC2**: CC6.1, CC8.1
- **Effort**: 15 min.

### [ ] 13. Add a smoke test for `scripts/check-edge-auth.ts`

- **Where**: `scripts/check-edge-auth.ts` or a new test beside it.
- **How**: Add a test case that creates a dummy edge function without
  any of the required imports and asserts the script exits non-zero.
  The guard itself is untested today.
- **SOC2**: CC8.1
- **Effort**: ~30 min.

## SOC2 mapping summary

| Criterion | Open items |
| --- | --- |
| CC6.1 (logical access) | 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 12 |
| CC6.7 (transmission integrity) | 6 |
| CC7.1 (system operations / capacity) | 3 |
| CC7.2 (monitoring / PII in logs) | 4 |
| CC7.3 (security incident response) | 7, 8 |
| CC8.1 (change management) | 5, 10, 11, 12, 13 |
| A1.2 (availability) | 2, 3 |

## Recommended order

1. Item 1 (unguarded `suggested-articles`)
2. Item 2 (rate-limit the other public endpoints)
3. Item 3 (size caps on request bodies)
4. Item 4 (stop logging `visitor_id`)
5. Item 8 (audit log for destructive actions)
6. Item 7 (rotate or replace `CONFIG_BYPASS_KEY`)
7. Item 9 (RLS as belt-and-braces)

Items 1–4 are exploitable today and should land before the next audit
window. Items 5–9 are SOC2 prep. Items 10–13 are hygiene.

## Do-Not-Regress

Invariants established by past security work. Breaking one without a
replacement is a regression, not a refactor.

- **`/conversations` endpoint — if it comes back, the visitor-token
  scheme (or an equivalent per-visitor auth mechanism) MUST come back
  with it.** The original endpoint returned a visitor's full
  conversation history keyed only by the (publicly visible) `visitor_id`.
  That was fixed by C-2 (HMAC-signed `X-Visitor-Token`). Endpoint and
  fix were both removed together on 2026-04-23 because the endpoint had
  no production callers. If a visitor-facing history UI lands later,
  re-introducing the endpoint without a per-visitor auth scheme would
  re-open C-2. See
  [SECURITY_REVIEW.md](SECURITY_REVIEW.md) C-2, and
  [CONVERSATIONS_ENDPOINT_REMOVAL.md](../../docs/security/CONVERSATIONS_ENDPOINT_REMOVAL.md)
  in the parent repo.

## Short-lived follow-ups

- **Remove the `divee_visitor_token` localStorage-cleanup line in
  `widget.js`** after two release cycles have shipped (earliest:
  ~2026-06). The line is a one-release bridge to purge residual tokens
  from visitors upgrading from the pre-removal widget. After the bridge
  window, the call is dead weight.
