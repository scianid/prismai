## The Problem

### The "Read & Run" Reality

- **Static Fatigue:** Readers consume an article and immediately bounce. They don't dig deeper because the friction of finding more info is too high.

- **Information Overload:** Long-form content is often skimmed. Key insights are missed because readers can't "ctrl+f" for concepts, only words.

- **Loss of Revenue:** Every time a reader leaves to Google a term or a follow-up question, the publisher loses a monetization opportunity.
